      <h2>Scene 1: Budgeting</h2>
      <p>You receive your first paycheck of $1,000. What will you do with it?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding income and expenses: You have $500 in essential expenses, and you have $500 remaining.</li>
        <li>Types of budgets: You could use the 50/30/20 rule, which suggests 50% of your income should go to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings.</li>
        <li>Tracking spending: It's important to track your spending so you can adjust if you're overspending in certain categories.</li>
      </ul>
      <button class="choice" onclick="makeChoice(1, '50/30/20 rule')">Follow the 50/30/20 rule</button>

      <h2>Scene 2: Saving and Investing</h2>
      <p>You have some extra cash after budgeting. How will you manage it?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Importance of saving: It's crucial to have an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses like medical bills or car repairs.</li>
        <li>Types of savings accounts: A high-yield savings account offers a better interest rate than a regular savings account, helping your money grow faster.</li>
        <li>Introduction to investments: Stocks offer potential high returns but come with risk. Bonds are lower risk but typically offer lower returns.</li>

    <section id="scene3" class="scene">
      <h2>Scene 3: Credit</h2>
      <p>You applied for a credit card, and it has a $300 limit. What will you do?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is credit?: Credit allows you to borrow money and pay it back later, usually with interest.</li>
        <li>Types of credit: A credit card is a revolving type of credit where you borrow money up to a limit and pay it back later, while a mortgage is for buying a home.</li>
        <li>Building and maintaining good credit: To maintain a good credit score, it's essential to make payments on time and keep your credit utilization low (use less than 30% of your available credit).</li>
      </ul>
